# MarkerAlgorithmWithMachineLearning
指導教授給的小專題，根據論文，實作出演算法

Using machine learning to improve a classic algorithm, Marker algorithm is a online algorithm for caching

How to run it?
1.clone the repository 
2.run the "main.py" by "python main.py test" (argument test are for comparing the ml-oracle method and the classic method)


The follow command will run a certain method of the Marker algorithm, the second one is the ML improved one:

You can also run : a)"python main.py random" ,  b) "python main.py ml_oralce"
